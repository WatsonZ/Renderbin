-- Every query below carries `user_id = sqlc.arg(user_id)`, so a slug belonging
-- to another user simply doesn't match: reads return sql.ErrNoRows and writes

-- gets. Ownership therefore lives in the schema, not in a Go check a caller
-- can forget -- and because sqlc runs with emit_interface: false, dropping the

-- New file queries belong in this section and MUST carry the predicate.
